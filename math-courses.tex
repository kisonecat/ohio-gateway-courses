  \frametitle{Examples of Revisions from College Algebra}

  Revised Outcomes

1. Functions: Successful College Algebra students demonstrate a deep understanding of functions whether they are described verbally, numerically, graphically, or algebraically (both explicitly and implicitly).  Students should be proficient working with the following families of functions:  linear, quadratic, higher-order polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, radical, and piecewise-defined functions (including absolute value).    

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Examples of Revisions from College Algebra}

  Revised Outcomes

The successful College Algebra student can: 
 
1a. Analyze functions.  Routine analysis includes discussion of domain, range, zeros, general function behavior (increasing, decreasing, extrema, etc.).  In addition to performing rote processes, the student can articulate reasons for choosing a particular process, recognize function families and anticipate behavior, and explain the implementation of a process (e.g., why certain real numbers are excluded from the domain of a given function).

  A mathematics pathway:
\begin{itemize}
  \item is a math course or sequence of courses taken by students (both college-ready and underprepared) to meet the requirements of their program of study;
  \item allows students to actively engage with mathematical concepts, access prior knowledge, and reflect on new learning;
  \item aligns with specific fields of study.
