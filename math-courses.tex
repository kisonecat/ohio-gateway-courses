  To develop expectations and processes that result in each campus offering pathways that result in mathematics that yield:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item increased success for students in the study of mathematics
    \item a higher percentage of students completing degree     
      programs
    \item effective transferability of credits for students moving 
      from one institution to another
  \end{enumerate}
  
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Essential Components}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop high-quality entry-level courses and pathways
    \item Develop transfer policies and processes that foster transfer and encourage innovation
    \item Support constructive engagement of mathematics chairpersons and faculty
    \item Collect, analyze, and share relevant data
    \item Improve student success in college-level mathematics by aligning postsecondary expectations and high school practice

  \textbf{Increasing departmental flexibility regarding pre-requisites

  \textbf{Creating a college-level mathematics course definition}

  \begin{quote}
A credit-bearing, college-level course in Mathematics must use the standards required for high school graduation by the State of Ohio as a basis and must do at least one of the following:  1) broaden, or 2) deepen, or 3) extend the student’s learning.\end{quote}

1.1 Represent functions verbally, numerically, graphically, and algebraically, including linear, quadratic, polynomial, rational, root/radical/power, exponential, logarithmic and piecewise-defined functions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Examples of Revisions from College Algebra}

  Revised Outcomes

1. Functions: Successful College Algebra students demonstrate a deep understanding of functions whether they are described verbally, numerically, graphically, or algebraically (both explicitly and implicitly).  Students should be proficient working with the following families of functions:  linear, quadratic, higher-order polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, radical, and piecewise-defined functions (including absolute value).    

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Examples of Revisions from College Algebra}

  Revised Outcomes

The successful College Algebra student can: 
 
1a. Analyze functions.  Routine analysis includes discussion of domain, range, zeros, general function behavior (increasing, decreasing, extrema, etc.).  In addition to performing rote processes, the student can articulate reasons for choosing a particular process, recognize function families and anticipate behavior, and explain the implementation of a process (e.g., why certain real numbers are excluded from the domain of a given function).

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What is a math pathway?}

  A mathematics pathway:
\begin{itemize}
  \item is a math course or sequence of courses taken by students (both college-ready and underprepared) to meet the requirements of their program of study;
  \item allows students to actively engage with mathematical concepts, access prior knowledge, and reflect on new learning;
  \item aligns with specific fields of study.
\end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item develop high-quality entry-level courses and pathways
  \item increase student success
  \item make mathematics more relevant to all students
  \item provide students with the appropriate mathematics to successfully support them in their chosen field of study
